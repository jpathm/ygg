# ygg — Git Worktree Helper

ygg manages git worktrees stored in `.worktrees/` inside the repo root. Each worktree gets its own branch and directory, enabling isolated parallel work.

## Commands

```bash
ygg new <name>       # Create worktree + branch, then open a multiplexer workspace/subshell
ygg list             # List all worktrees (* = current, [modified] = uncommitted changes)
ygg switch <name>    # Switch to an existing worktree (alias: sw)
ygg remove [name]    # Remove a worktree; omit name when inside the worktree (alias: rm)
ygg remove -f [name] # Force remove even with uncommitted/unmerged changes
ygg clean            # Remove worktrees whose branches are merged to default
ygg clean --dry-run  # Preview what clean would remove
ygg clean --force    # Clean without confirmation prompts
```

## Typical Workflow

1. `ygg new <feature-name>` — start isolated work on a feature
2. Do work, commit, open PR
3. After merge: `ygg clean` to remove merged worktrees

## Key Behaviors

- `ygg new` fetches latest from origin, bases the branch on `main`/`master`, and copies untracked files from the main worktree
- Sets `$YGG_WORKTREE` env var inside the shell for prompt integration
- Tmux and Zellij are detected via `$TMUX`/`$ZELLIJ`: ygg opens or focuses a named `<repo>/<worktree>` workspace instead of nesting a shell
- Tmux takes precedence when both variables are set, and operates only in the current tmux session
- `ygg remove` and `ygg clean` close matching multiplexer workspaces after removing worktrees
- Inside an existing ygg shell, `ygg new` and `ygg switch` emit a `cd` command for the wrapper to evaluate before multiplexer detection
- `ygg remove` without a name removes the current worktree (if inside one) and returns you to main

## When Helping the User

- Always use `ygg new <name>` to create worktrees — never raw `git worktree add`
- Suggest `ygg clean` after merging multiple PRs to tidy up
- Use `ygg list` to check what worktrees exist before switching or removing
- Prefer `ygg remove` over `ygg remove -f` unless the user explicitly wants to discard unmerged work
